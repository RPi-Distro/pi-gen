# Raspberry Pi BTCT Node

Based on the official Raspbian image, using pi-gen to create. Should work on any Pi hardware that supports Raspbian Buster. Tested on Pi4 w/ 4GB and Pi3.

Note: This version of the image includes a bootstrap of the BTCT chain as of about 23:00 UTC on 01/17/2020.

After booting up, go through the setup wizard and reboot.

Click on the raspberry menu at the top left and you should find Bitcoin Token (this is the -QT wallet).

BE SURE TO ENCRYPT AND BACKUP YOUR WALLET! If you forget your password, no one can help you. If you are unsure what you are doing, come to the Discord server and ask -> https://discord.gg/4cAGCf4

NO ONE WILL NEVER DM YOU AND ASK YOU FOR YOUR PASSWORD OR PRIVATE KEYS OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION. If someone claiming to be a BTCT admin (or anyone) does, block them and report to the mods of whatever servers you have in common with the scammer.

READ THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE AGAIN! NEVER GIVE OUT YOUR PASSWORD OR PRIVATE KEYS TO ANYONE UNLESS YOU LIKE HAVING ALL YOUR CRYPTO STOLEN FROM YOU.

## Instructions for etching

Download the IMG file: https://github.com/bitcointokenbtct/BTCT-Rasp-Pi-Image/releases/download/v1.0/image_2020-01-17-btct-1.1.zip

Use Etcher (https://www.balena.io/etcher/). No need to unzip the image first, Etcher will do that for you. Just download and point etcher to the .zip file.

Use a 16GB SD Card minimum, but recommend you go for 32 or 64GB, the blockchain will grow. Get something with decent speed.

AGAIN: BE SURE TO ENCRYPT AND BACKUP YOUR WALLET! SD Cards can and will go bad. Back up your wallet and make sure you know the password.
