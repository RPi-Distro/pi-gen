# This file contains a netplan-compatible configuration which cloud-init will
# apply on first-boot (note: it will *not* update the config after the first
# boot). Please refer to the cloud-init documentation and the netplan reference
# for full details:

# Please note that the YAML format employed by this file is sensitive to
# differences in whitespace; if you are editing this file in an editor (like
# Notepad) which uses literal tabs, take care to only use spaces for
# indentation. See the following link for more details:

#
# Additionally, please be aware that if your boot sequence depends on active
# networking (e.g. if your cloud-init configuration pulls packages or SSH
# keys from the network), you *must* mark at least one interface as required
# ("optional: false") below. Otherwise, particularly on faster boards,
# cloud-init will start attempting to use the network before it is ready

# Some additional examples are commented out below

#  version: 2
