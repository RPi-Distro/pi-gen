#cloud-config

# This is the user-data configuration file for cloud-init. By default this sets
# up an initial user called "ubuntu" with password "ubuntu", which must be
# changed at first login. However, many additional actions can be initiated on
# first boot from this file. The cloud-init documentation has more details:
#
# https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/
#
# Please note that the YAML format employed by this file is sensitive to
# differences in whitespace; if you are editing this file in an editor (like
# Notepad) which uses literal tabs, take care to only use spaces for
# indentation. See the following link for more details:
#
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML
#
# Some additional examples are provided in comments below the default
# configuration.

## Set the system's hostname. Please note that, unless you have a local DNS
## setup where the hostname is derived from DHCP requests (as with dnsmasq),
## setting the hostname here will not make the machine reachable by this name.
## You may also wish to install avahi-daemon (see the "packages:" key below)
## to make your machine reachable by the .local domain
#hostname: raspberrypi

## Set up the keyboard layout. See localectl(1), in particular the various
## list-x11-* sub-commands, to determine the available models, layouts,
## variants, and options
#keyboard:
#  model: pc105
#  layout: gb
#  variant:
#  options: ctrl:nocaps

# Controls password authentication with the SSH daemon; the default here can
# prevent logging into SSH with a password. Changing this is a security risk
# and you should at the very least ensure a different default password is
# specified above
#ssh_pwauth: false

## On first boot, use ssh-import-id to give the specific users SSH access to
## the default user
#ssh_import_id:
#- lp:my_launchpad_username
#- gh:my_github_username

## Add users and groups to the system, and import keys with the ssh-import-id
## utility
#groups:
#- robot: [robot]
#- robotics: [robot]
#- pi
#
#users:
#- default
#- name: robot
#  gecos: Mr. Robot
#  primary_group: robot
#  groups: users
#  ssh_import_id: foobar
#  lock_passwd: false
#  passwd: $5$hkui88$nvZgIle31cNpryjRfO9uArF7DYiBcWEnjqq7L1AQNN3

## Update apt database and upgrade packages on first boot
#package_update: true
#package_upgrade: true

## Install additional packages on first boot
#packages:
#- avahi-daemon
#- rng-tools
#- python3-gpiozero
#- [python3-serial, 3.5-1]
