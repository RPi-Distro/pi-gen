# This is the meta-data configuration file for cloud-init. Please refer to the
# cloud-init documentation for more information:

# Set the datasource mode to "local". This ensures that user-data is acted upon
# prior to bringing up the network (because everything about the datasource is
# assumed to be local). If you wish to use an HTTP datasource instead, you can
# change this to "net" or override it on the kernel cmdline (see README).
dsmode: local

# Specifies the "unique" identifier of the instance. Typically in cloud-init
# this is generated by the owning cloud and is actually unique (to some
# degree). Here our data-source is local, so this is just a fixed string.
# Warning: changing this will cause cloud-init to assume it is running on a
# "new" instance, and to go through first time setup again (the value is
# compared to a cached copy).
instance_id: rpios-image
