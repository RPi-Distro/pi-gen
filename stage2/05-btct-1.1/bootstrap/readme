The bootstrap files are large can't be uploaded to github very easily, so this ia a placeholder.

Get a recent bootstrap archive from the releases (whatever is latest) and extract to here:

bootstrap/blocks
bootstrap/chainstate
bootstrap/index
bootstrap/sporks

Note: the contents of index go in bootstrap/blocks/index but you must separate them out like this for pi-gen to work and place files correctly.
